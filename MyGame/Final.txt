You've scurried past some zombies so now you have a pack of them
chasing after you. You're running as fast as you can and at this point 
your flashlight is totally dead.

As you're running as fast as you can, praying that the universe will
let you see another day, a little dot of light appears in the sea of
black that you are running in.

*BLKAHEAKJZZEHF*
It's like these zombies used to be track stars because they can run so 
freakin' fast! But a second wind kicks in and you give the last stretch 
all you have and...

*SLAM*
You tackle the door open and you made it out! CONGRADULATIONS!! Now you 
have to deal with your next problem which includes finding other normal
people, food, water, shelter, etc. and also the zombies that were chasing 
you like 10 seconds ago.

Nice job and good luck! Hope you studied up on The Walking Dead. :)
