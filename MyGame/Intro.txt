You succesfully open the case and see a flashlight shiny revolver with a
handful of rounds. You are very familiar with how to use one these
because you grew up in Wyoming's backcountry where your father
taught you how to shoot guns.

You quickly load the gun and as soon as you cock back the hammer, 
the girl's strength gives out and a fat ugly zombie squeezes 
through the door. You take aim and BOOM, a perfect shot sends the
zombie to the ground wishing, he had just settled for squirrel
this morning.

"Whew! That was close!...What's your name?" the girl asks.
"OK, (name), my name's Zoey, now that we're done with introductions,
get up and let's get..."

"BLAHFPTTZCHA!" as Zoey steps through the door, a zombie laying on the ground
that appeared to be dead raises his head and takes a bite at her ankle!
She quickly pulls back in a shreak and the violent zombie virus immediately
starts to take over.

You get up and realize you have 3 choices, what do you do?:
1. Holster your gun and try to help her.
2. Shoot her in the brains!
3. Quickly run past her!
