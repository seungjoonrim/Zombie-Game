You wake up on the floor of a dark room in a daze and your vision is 
all blurry. As you try to gather yourself, your hearing starts to come back 
and you hear screaming.

It's coming from a girl in front of you and she's fighting to keep
a door closed.

"HEY! HEY! LOOK TO YOUR LEFT!," she says.
You look left and you see a brief case locked by a 4-number
combination lock.

You recognize this briefcase; It belongs to your friend, and
you know that your friend was a huge fan of Dr. Dre. Therefore,
the code to the case must have something to do with Dr. Dre's work.
You quickly grab the case to try and guess the code.
